The strikes put nearby oil-producing Gulf Arab countries on edge as fears of escalation in the region grew, and Israel said Tehran responded by launching missiles towards Israel.

The first wave of strikes in what the Pentagon named "OPERATION EPIC FURY" mainly targeted Iranian officials, a source familiar with the matter said.

An Israeli official said Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted but the result of the strikes was not clear. A source with knowledge of the matter had earlier told Reuters that Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.

An Iranian source close to the establishment said several senior commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guards and political officials had been killed. Reuters could not independently confirm the report.

The renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes further dimmed hopes of a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West. A third round of indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran this week failed to provide a breakthrough that could avert a new war.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said a first wave of retaliatory Iranian missile and drone attacks had been launched against Israel and that all U.S. bases and interests in the region were within Iran's reach, an Iranian official told Reuters.

Bahrain said the service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been subjected to a missile attack. Video footage from witnesses in Bahrain showed a thick grey plume of smoke rising from near the small island state's coastline as sirens wailed.

At least half a dozen witnesses, including Reuters correspondents, heard loud booms in various parts of the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, a major oil producer and close U.S. ally.

One witness told Reuters she heard five booms in rapid succession that caused windows in the house near Abu Dhabi's Corniche to vibrate. Other witnesses in the Al Dhafra and Bateen areas heard loud booms as well.

Fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar said it had downed all missiles targeting the country, the state news agency reported.

Explosions were heard near Iran's Kharg Island. Iran exports 90 percent of its crude oil via Kharg, for shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz.

Global airlines cancelled flights across the Middle East.

In a video message published on social media, Trump cited Washington's decades-long dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.

He urged Iranians to stay sheltered because "bombs will be dropping everywhere". But he also added: "When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”

The U.S. military initiated a series of strikes against targets in Iran, two U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The scope of the air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, said a U.S. official.

Iran was preparing a crushing retaliation, an Iranian official told Reuters.

“We are being killed by the regime and by Israel. We are the victims of this regime’s hostile policies,” said Maryam, 54, a housewife in Tehran, as she headed to northern Iran with her family.
Witnesses said people were rushing to banks to withdraw cash. Long queues formed at gas stations across cities. Many also worried about a potential internet blackout that would cut off communication with their families abroad.

Trump had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in the nuclear talks. He said the U.S. had launched a "massive and ongoing" operation against the Islamic Republic, vowing to ensure Tehran will not obtain a nuclear weapon.

Iran's ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point in negotiations. Trump said Iran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S.

"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime," Trump said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran "will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands."

"The time has come for all sections of the people in Iran ... to remove the yoke of tyranny ... and bring a free and peace-loving Iran," Netanyahu said in a statement.

The attack follows a 12-day air war in June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said the strieks - launched against Muslim-majority Iran during Ramadan, the holy Muslim month of fasting observed from dawn to sunset - was a pre-emptive attack to remove threats to Israel.

An Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.

The Israeli military announced the closure of schools and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights.

The U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February to try to resolve the nuclear dispute.

Iran, which denies seeking atomic bombs, said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions but ruled out linking the issue to its missiles.

Last June, the U.S. joined an Israeli military campaign against Iranian nuclear installations, in the most direct American military action ever against the Islamic Republic.

Tehran retaliated then by launching missiles toward the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest in the Middle East.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F3RMO3NPSVOYFKIFRCMSNH4W7M.jpg?auth=acb7239537bb2a9e9d113e71c8b764c8f24498bed5673c2c6f7ec67c2ecd4740&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Airlines suspend Middle East flights after US, Israel strikes on Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/airlines-suspend-middle-east-flights-after-us-israel-strikes-iran-2026-02-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Global airlines suspended flights across the Middle East on Saturday after the United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran, plunging the region into a renewed military confrontation.

Flight maps showed the airspace over Iran virtually empty as Israel said it struck Iran and the U.S. military initiated a series of strikes against targets in the country. Iran retaliated with a salvo of missiles.

The escalation dimmed hopes for a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West and reignited conflict after weeks of U.S. military buildup in the region.

It marks the latest upheaval for air travel in the usually busy region amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. With Russian and Ukrainian airspace closed to most airlines due to years of war, the Middle East has become a more important route for flights between Europe and Asia.

Conflict zones are an increasing operational burden on airlines as aerial attacks raise worries about accidental or deliberate shoot-downs of commercial air traffic. Longer flight times also require more fuel, adding to their costs.

Israel, Iran, Iraq and Jordan closed their airspace following the attacks and a map of the region on Flightradar24 showed airplanes avoiding these areas.

A number of Qatar Airways flights departed on Saturday morning, circled over Kuwait or Saudi Arabia before returning to Qatari airspace and were circling off Doha, according to Flightradar24.

The Russian Ministry of Transport said on Saturday that Russian air carriers had suspended flights to Iran and Israel.

Germany's Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) , opens new tab said it was suspending flights to and from Dubai on Saturday and Sunday and halting temporarily the Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman routes until March 7. Air France cancelled flights to and From Tel Aviv and Beirut.

Iberia also cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, while Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab suspended flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman with immediate effect until the same date, it said.

Kuwait's aviation authority said it was halting all flights to Iran until further notice, according to the state news agency, while Oman Air said it had suspended all flights to Baghdad due to the regional developments.

The United Arab Emirates "partially and temporarily" closed its airspace as a precaution, its state news agency said.

"Due to the temporary closure of several airspace in the region on 28 February, some flydubai flights have been impacted," a spokesperson for the Emirati carrier said.

KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab , has brought forward the suspension of its Amsterdam–Tel Aviv service, cancelling the flight scheduled for Saturday after strikes in Iran, a spokesperson said.

The airline had announced on Wednesday that flights would be halted from Sunday, March 1. Only one flight to Tel Aviv had been scheduled for Saturday.

Virgin Atlantic said it had decided to temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, resulting in some re-routing of its flights. Qatar Airways said it had halted air traffic temporarily as a precaution.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JN6CBRPC4RIRXH2RAQHWDMS6D4.jpg?auth=7f6f38b34445b4754b228372470e49d0066120ab8e3590cf73050300884f5ec2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan, Afghan Taliban forces clash as diplomatic efforts intensify</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-afghan-taliban-forces-clash-diplomatic-efforts-intensify-2026-02-28/</link><description>KABUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban military entered its third day on Saturday, following overnight clashes as the international community expressed increasing concern about the conflict and called for urgent talks.

Pakistan's strikes on Friday hit Taliban military installations and posts, including in Kabul and Kandahar, in one of the deepest Pakistani incursions into its western neighbour in years, officials said.

Islamabad accuses the Taliban of harbouring Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants, who it claims are waging an insurgency inside Pakistan, a charge the Taliban denies.

Pakistan described its actions as a response to cross-border assaults, while Kabul denounced them as a breach of its sovereignty, saying it remained open to dialogue but warned any wider conflict would result in serious consequences.

The fighting has raised the risk of a protracted conflict along the rugged 2,600-km (1,615-mile) frontier.

Diplomatic efforts gathered pace late on Friday as Afghanistan said its foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, spoke by telephone with Saudi Arabia's Prince Faisal bin Farhan about reducing tensions and keeping diplomatic channels open.

The European Union called for both sides to de-escalate and engage in dialogue, while the United Nations urged an immediate end to hostilities.

Russia urged both sides to halt the clashes and return to talks, while China said it was deeply concerned and ready to help ease tensions.

The United States supports Pakistan's right to defend itself against attacks by the Taliban, a State Department spokesperson said.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, adding Washington hoped the situation would not escalate further.

Exchanges of fire continued along the border overnight.

Pakistani security sources said an operation dubbed "Ghazab Lil Haq" was ongoing and that Pakistani forces had destroyed multiple Taliban posts and camps in several sectors. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.

Both sides have reported heavy losses with conflicting tolls that Reuters could not verify. Pakistan said 12 of its soldiers and 274 Taliban were killed while the Taliban said 13 of its fighters and 55 Pakistani soldiers died.

Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim.

Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said "our cup of patience has overflowed" and described the fighting as "open war", warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks.

Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict "will be very costly," and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged.

He said the Taliban had defeated "the world, not through technology, but through unity and solidarity," and through "great patience and perseverance," rather than superior military power.

Pakistan's military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force.

In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces.

However, the Islamist group is battle-hardened after two decades of insurgency against U.S.-led forces before returning to power in 2021.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GDL6TRGHRJJMZH67BZ452JTLBU.jpg?auth=1f66069e1d0611a99047f5cf4fa849785c913985c8fdbab9fc763e17ed791764&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Satellite images show more aircraft at Saudi airbase used by US forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/satellite-images-show-more-aircraft-saudi-airbase-used-by-us-forces-2026-02-27/</link><description>Feb 27 (Reuters) - Satellite images showed a rise in the number of military support aircraft including refuelling tankers at a Saudi airbase used by the U.S. military during a four-day period in February, as Washington built forces in the region amid tensions with Iran.

Saudi Arabia, a longstanding U.S. ally, told Iran last month it would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, which held indirect negotiations with Washington on Thursday over its nuclear programme.

In a high-resolution satellite image taken on February 21, at least 43 aircraft were visible at Saudi Arabia's Prince Sultan Airbase - which has hosted U.S. forces for decades - compared with 27 aircraft visible in a February 17 image.

The number dropped to 38 in a February 25 image.

The aircraft in the February 21 image included 13 Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and six Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft known as AWACS, among a total of 29 large, swept-wing aircraft parked at the base, William Goodhind, a forensic imagery analyst with Contested Ground, told Reuters.

In the February 17, medium-resolution image, 11 large, swept-wing aircraft were visible, according to a Reuters tally.

Asked for comment, the Pentagon said it had "nothing to provide". The U.S. military does not usually comment on force movements.

The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oman, which is mediating between the United States and Iran, said the sides made progress in talks on Thursday, though there was no sign of a breakthrough that could avert potential U.S. strikes.

Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said on Thursday the sides plan to resume negotiations soon after consultations in their countries' capitals, with technical-level discussions scheduled to take place next week in Vienna.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on February 19 that Iran must make a deal in 10 to 15 days, warning that "really bad things" would otherwise happen.

A comparison of satellite imagery in early February with those taken in January also showed a build-up of aircraft and other military equipment across the region.

Recent satellite images have also shown Iran repairing and fortifying sites, including a sensitive military site reportedly bombed by Israel in 2024.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZ5YCAIGM5K25KUJDXZNLNGIQY.jpg?auth=a375a627cd3832b9acd627a985b4f04443030276a9538b062f337f7c2063977c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US-Iran talks end with no deal but potential signs of progress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-iran-nuclear-talks-resume-geneva-against-backdrop-military-threat-2026-02-26/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - (This Feb 26 story has been corrected to fix the day of the week to Thursday, not Tuesday, in paragraph 5)

The United States and Iran made progress in talks over Tehran's nuclear program on Thursday, mediator Oman said, but hours of negotiation ended with no sign of a breakthrough that could avert potential U.S. strikes amid a massive military buildup.

The two sides plan to resume negotiations soon after consultations in their countries' capitals, with technical-level discussions scheduled to take place next week in Vienna, Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said in a post on X after the day's meetings in Switzerland.

Badr Albusaidi will hold talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and other U.S. officials in Washington on Friday, MS NOW reported late on Thursday. Neither the White House nor Oman's embassy in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment.

Any substantial move toward an elusive agreement between longtime foes Washington and Tehran could reduce the imminent prospects for U.S President Donald Trump to carry out a threatened attack on Iran that many fear could escalate into a wider war.

But Thursday's indirect talks wrapped up without a deal, still leaving the region on edge.

The Omani minister's upbeat assessment followed indirect talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Geneva, with one session in the morning and the second in the afternoon.

"We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran," Badr Albusaidi said.

But with many analysts seeing the latest diplomacy as the last chance before Trump could decide to go to war, Badr Albusaidi provided no details and stopped short of saying the two sides had overcome their biggest stumbling blocks to a deal.

Describing the talks as some of the most serious that Iran has had with the U.S., Araqchi told Iranian state television: "We reached agreement on some issues, and there are differences regarding some other issues."

“It was decided that the next round of negotiations will take place soon, in less than a week," he said. The Iranians, he added, had clearly expressed their demand for lifting of U.S. sanctions, which Washington has long insisted will only come after deep concessions from Tehran.

There was no immediate comment from the U.S. negotiating team on the outcome of the talks. But Axios quoted a senior U.S. official as saying the Geneva negotiations were “positive.”

The discussions about the decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear work come as fears grow of a Middle East conflagration. Trump has repeatedly threatened action if there is no deal, and the U.S. military has amassed its forces in waters near the Islamic Republic.

A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier on Thursday that the U.S. and Iran could reach a framework for a deal if Washington separated "nuclear and non-nuclear issues."

The Trump administration has insisted that Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups in the region must be part of the negotiations.

After the morning session, Badr Albusaidi said the two sides had exchanged "creative and positive ideas".

But a senior Iranian official said at the time that some gaps still had to be narrowed.

Washington, which believes Tehran seeks the ability to build a nuclear bomb, wants Iran to give up all uranium enrichment, a process that makes fuel for atomic power plants but that can also yield material for a warhead.

Iran has long denied wanting a bomb and said earlier on Thursday it would show flexibility at the talks. Reuters reported on Sunday that Tehran was offering undefined new concessions in return for removal of sanctions and recognition of its right to enrich uranium.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Iran's refusal to discuss its ballistic missile program was a "big problem" which would have to be addressed eventually.

The missiles were "designed solely to strike America" and pose a threat to regional stability, he said, but offered no proof to back the claim that U.S. territory could be targeted.

Trump said on February 19 that Iran must make a deal in 10 to 15 days, warning that "really bad things" would otherwise happen.

He briefly laid out his case for a possible attack on Iran in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, underlining that while he preferred a diplomatic solution, he would not allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon.

In June, the U.S. joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites and has been ramping up the pressure on Tehran again since January, when Trump threatened to intervene over its crushing of nationwide protests with thousands killed.

Since then, Trump has deployed fighter jets and aircraft carrier strike groups in the region.

Iran responded to last summer's strikes by firing fusillades of missiles at Israel and has threatened to retaliate fiercely if attacked again, raising fears of a wider regional conflict that has alarmed Gulf oil producers.

Within Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei faces the gravest crisis of his 36-year tenure, with an economy buckling under tightened sanctions and renewed protests following the major unrest and crackdown in January.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that Khamenei has banned weapons of mass destruction, which "clearly means Tehran won't develop nuclear weapons," reiterating a religious decree issued in the early 2000s.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZKPAICGORPOVE2JFMC5M7MGFE.jpg?auth=6820be33a0d74dbd317755287faefa3a14015cb56b38b1ccbd781ac5ff9efe0f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says of Iran: 'Sometimes you have to use force'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-more-iran-talks-expected-friday-2026-02-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment on Friday about U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program and warned that "sometimes you have to use force," amid a massive military presence in the region that could presage strikes on the Islamic Republic.

Trump has increased diplomatic and military pressure on Iran in the weeks since an Iranian crackdown on protesters, attempting to force the country's rulers to forswear nuclear weapons and other activities Washington sees as destabilizing.

After the latest round of talks on Thursday in Geneva ended without a deal, Trump's patience appeared to be wearing thin, although he said he had not made a final decision on the use of force.

"They don't want to say the key words, 'We're not going to have a nuclear weapon,'" Trump said on Friday before an event in Corpus Christi, Texas. "So I'm not happy with the negotiation."

Iran denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons and wants any accord to include the lifting of U.S. sanctions against it.

'PEACE DEAL WITHIN REACH': ALBUSAIDI

Trump spoke a day after negotiations between U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and Iranian officials in Geneva ended without news of a deal, although Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was a mediator, said the talks made significant progress.

Albusaidi told CBS earlier on Friday, before Trump's latest remarks, that a "peace deal is within our reach ... if we just allow diplomacy the space it needs to get there."

Iran has agreed in principle that it would never have nuclear material that could be used to create a weapon, Albusaidi said, adding that "if we can capture that and build on it, I think a deal is within our reach."

A big U.S. military force, including two aircraft carrier groups, is in the region waiting on Trump's order.

While Trump's timing for a final decision is unclear, the State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks in Israel with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and Monday.

The United States joined Israel’s bombing campaign against Iran in June, striking major nuclear facilities.

Asked about the potential for use of force, Trump said the United States has the greatest military in the world.

"I'd love not to use it, but sometimes you have to," he said.

Trump said more discussions on Iran would take place later in the day.

He did not specify with whom, but Oman, which has been acting as a mediator between the two countries, sent its foreign minister to Washington on Friday for discussions on the issue with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Top U.S. defense officials were at the White House on Thursday for talks.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Friday that the State Department had designated Iran as a “State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention.”

Rubio said for decades Iran has wrongfully detained Americans and citizens of other nations “to use as political leverage against other states,” adding that the U.S. could consider additional measures, including a potential “geographic travel restriction on the use of U.S. passports to, through, or from Iran.”

Trump planned events in Corpus Christi later on Friday and then was to fly to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club.

A source briefed on the internal White House deliberations told Reuters that Trump is “very clear-eyed on all the options before him.”

There is a recognition internally that taking on Iran would be more difficult than the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, and there was also internal pessimism as to whether negotiations will bear fruit, the source said.

"Nobody is super optimistic about the negotiations," the source said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DVX7CLH4GJIIZLECCB5FFBKVEE.jpg?auth=bd7f2913ef8cc8469df900bda98e9ca0f918af1c0760a17c3412dd5c89167441&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Argentina Senate approves Milei-backed labor reform</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-senate-approves-milei-backed-labor-reform-2026-02-28/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Feb 27 - Argentina’s Senate on Friday approved a labor reform backed by President Javier Milei, giving it final clearance to become law and landing the libertarian leader one of his most significant legislative wins.

Milei's administration argues the reform, which passed with 42 votes in favor, 28 against, and two abstentions, will spur investment and create formal jobs, while labor unions contend it weakens worker protections, including the right to strike.

The reform is expected to bolster investor confidence in Milei’s market-driven reforms.

Passage of the bill is seen by analysts as a signal that Milei has the political backing to advance his broader free‑market agenda.

Since taking office, Milei has stabilized the exchange rate and sharply cooled inflation, bringing monthly price increases down from double digits to 2.9% in January, gaining accolades from the International Monetary Fund.

One of the bill's most contentious provisions establishes an employer-financed severance fund consisting of contributions currently earmarked for the national pension system. The change could make it easier for companies to lay off workers and opposition lawmakers say the fund would impact the pension system's resources.

The reform also relaxes hiring rules, changes the vacation system, allows the standard workday to be extended from eight to 12 hours, and permits salaries to be paid in foreign currency.

Unions, which have mounted protests including a nationwide strike, object to new limits on the right to strike that require essential services to maintain minimum operations during work stoppages.

The labor reform is one of several legislative priorities for Milei’s administration. Lawmakers are also advancing changes to the law protecting Andean glaciers, a move the government says will unlock mining investment and which environmental groups strongly oppose.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMQVP77KP5LEHFW74TAYIYA76M.jpg?auth=8e8092d908f187e4ad2ca5d7c1a0335b59a4320a857e9d1ae4253e645974194f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bolivian military plane crash death toll rises to 20, AFP reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolivian-military-plane-crashes-el-alto-near-la-paz-2026-02-27/</link><description>LA PAZ, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The death toll has risen to 20 in the crash on Friday evening of a Bolivian Air Force Hercules aircraft during bad weather in the city of El Alto, near Bolivia's capital La Paz, AFP reported citing police.

The plane was carrying new banknotes from the country's central bank.

The military aircraft had departed from the city of Santa Cruz and crashed after landing and skidding off the runway onto a neighboring avenue, according to local authorities.

Social media footage showed chaotic scenes of people flocking to the scene of the crash, appearing to pick up money that lay strewn on the ground following the accident. Local authorities on the scene were warding off people using water hoses and tear gas. Reuters was unable to identify the images.

Bolivia's central bank was set to address reporters later on Friday evening.

The El Alto International Airport was closed temporarily following the crash, national airline Boliviana de Aviacion said in a statement, adding the aircraft involved in the accident did not belong to its fleet.

Video broadcast on local media showed the aircraft was severely damaged, as were a number of vehicles along the avenue where the crash took place.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bill Clinton to lawmakers investigating Epstein: 'I saw nothing'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bill-clinton-give-private-testimony-congress-about-epstein-2026-02-27/</link><description>Feb 27 (Reuters) - Bill Clinton told lawmakers on Friday that he "saw nothing that gave me pause" when he spent time with Jeffrey Epstein, as the former president gave closed-door testimony about his relationship with the late sex offender.

Clinton's closed-door appearance before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee marked the first time a current or former president has been compelled to testify before Congress.

Democrats on the panel said President Donald Trump should be subpoenaed as well, but the committee's Republican chairman, James Comer said that was not going to happen.

Both men socialized with Epstein before his 2008 conviction of soliciting prostitution from a minor. Both have repeatedly said they did not see any evidence of sex trafficking, and neither have been accused by authorities of criminal activity related to the late financier, who entertained a long list of business and financial leaders at his lavish residences in New York, Florida and the Caribbean.

In his testimony, Clinton told the committee that he would not have flown on the late financier's plane if he had known about his alleged sex trafficking of underage girls, and would have reported him if he did.

"We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long," Clinton said, speaking near his main residence in Chappaqua, New York.

Clinton flew on Epstein's plane several times in the early 2000s after he left office, and a tranche of millions of documents released by the Justice Department includes photos of Clinton with women whose faces are redacted.

"I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong," Clinton said.

Comer described the hearing as cordial and said Clinton was cooperative. "He's a charming individual, obviously," he said.

Clinton said the committee should not have subpoenaed his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who told the panel on Thursday that she did not remember ever meeting Epstein and had nothing to share about his sex crimes.

She said she was also asked about UFOs and a 2016-era conspiracy theory during the seven-hour session.

Comer said some of Hillary Clinton's answers had been inconsistent and would be examined for possible perjury.

He did not rule out the possibility of subpoenaing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who visited Epstein's Caribbean island after his 2008 conviction. "Stay tuned on that," he said.

Democrats said the investigation would not be credible if it does not examine Trump's role.

"President Clinton's presence here today under oath highlights the Donald Trump-sized gaping hole in Chairman Comer's investigation," said Democratic Representative James Walkinshaw of Virginia.

Democrats are also accusing Trump's Justice Department of withholding records of a woman who accused Trump of sexually abusing her when she was a minor. The Justice Department has said it is looking at the material and will publish it if appropriate, and has also warned that the material includes unfounded accusations about Trump.

Trump's name appears frequently in the Epstein files. He socialized extensively with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s and says he broke off ties before Epstein's 2008 conviction. Authorities have not accused him of criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, but the association has dogged him for decades.

At the White House, Trump expressed sympathy for Clinton, a Democrat.

"I don't like seeing him deposed," Trump said. "But they certainly went after me more than that."

The Clintons agreed to testify near their home in Chappaqua after the House threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate. Some Democrats supported the move.

Both Clintons accuse Republicans of conducting a partisan exercise designed to protect Trump from scrutiny, noting that others in the inquiry were allowed to submit written statements rather than testify in person.

Epstein died in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex-trafficking crimes. His death was ruled a suicide.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLMVHWMY4ZNF7FXHFOPFGUQBUU.jpg?auth=c5c66c42123d5981f3ff65d2e772565d9c19c2275236da9dc306ccc694f90ab7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Global reaction to Israeli, US attacks on Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-reaction-israeli-us-attacks-iran-2026-02-28/</link><description>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Israel and the United States launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, plunging the Middle East into a renewed military confrontation as President Donald Trump vowed to destroy Tehran's missile arsenal and prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.

Below is international reaction to the attacks:

"The question is who has more patience to wait for the inglorious end of their enemy. The USA is only 249 years old. The Persian Empire was founded more than 2,500 years ago. Let's see in 100 years…"

LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER NAWAF SALAM

"I reiterate that we will not accept anyone dragging the country into adventures that threaten its security and unity."

"The attack is described by Israel as a preventive strike, but it is not in line with international law.

Airspace over Iran and Iraq was empty on Saturday morning, maps by flight-tracking service Flightradar24 showed.

Below is the latest on flights listed by airline in alphabetical order:

Air France (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab cancelled flights  to and from Tel Aviv in Israel and Beirut in Lebanon for Saturday.

KLM brought forward the suspension of its Amsterdam–Tel Aviv service, cancelling the flight scheduled for Saturday. The Dutch arm of Air France‑KLM had announced on Wednesday that flights would be halted from Sunday, but has now advanced that date.

Only one flight to Tel Aviv had been scheduled for Saturday.

The airline said it was monitoring regional updates.

Japan Airlines (9201.T) , opens new tab cancelled a flight on Saturday from Tokyo Haneda to Doha as well as a return flight on March 1, Nikkei said.

The German airline (LHAG.DE) , opens new tab suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv in Israel, Beirut in Lebanon, and Oman until March 7 and flights to and from Dubai on Saturday and Sunday.

They also said they would not add Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Iraqi and Iranian airspace until March 7.

Virgin Atlantic said it will temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, resulting in some pre-planned rerouting of its flights and cancelled its VS400 service from London Heathrow to Dubai on Saturday.

The airline (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab halted flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman with immediate effect until March 7.

It added that operational decisions would continue to be reviewed, and the flight schedule could be adjusted as the situation evolves.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DJPRRSSV25JFPDVZ4BRAGVUBPQ.jpg?auth=fe17d834e3e5beff691fdb05ac02bcf3cf7cb36c1b08796e8ba268ebcf174934&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korean leader presents new sniper rifles to party officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/north-korean-leader-presents-new-sniper-rifles-party-officials-2026-02-28/</link><description>SEOUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has presented new sniper rifles as ceremonial gifts to party and military officials, calling them a "wonderful weapon" and a sign of his trust, state media KCNA news agency said on Saturday.

KCNA reported Kim met leading cadres and commanding officers at the headquarters of the Workers' Party of Korea on Friday and handed each a new-generation rifle developed by the country's Academy of Defence Science.

"As was already made public, this new-generation sniper's rifle our Academy of Defence Science developed and produced is really a wonderful weapon,” Kim was quoted as saying.

The gifts were presented to mark the Ninth Congress of the party.

Recipients included members of the party's Central Military Commission, senior commanders of the Korean People's Army and guard units, as well as Kim's sister Kim Yo Jong, whom KCNA for the first time identified as director of the General Affairs Department of the party's Central Committee.

Photographs published by KCNA showed Kim's teenage daughter, known as Ju Ae, attending the gift ceremony and aiming a rifle at a firing range.

Ju Ae, believed to be in her early teens, has been increasingly prominent in state media, accompanying her father on field guidance including inspections of weapons projects amid speculation by analysts that she is being groomed as the country's fourth-generation leader.

South Korea's National Intelligence Agency (NIS) believes the public role indicates she has started to provide policy input and that she is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader .

KCNA also released a photograph of Kim Yo Jong holding a rifle alongside Hyon Song Wol, an aide to the North Korean leader who is known to be close to his wife.

In a statement released after Israel and the United States launched strikes on Iran , Salam noted the "serious developments" in the region and called on "all Lebanese to act with wisdom and patriotism, placing Lebanon and the Lebanese people’s interests above any other consideration".

Hezbollah has fought numerous conflicts with Israel since it was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Israel had warned Lebanon that it would strike the country hard, targeting civilian infrastructure including the airport, in the event that Hezbollah gets involved in any U.S.-Iran war.

"I reiterate that we will not accept anyone dragging the country into adventures that threaten its security and unity," Salam said in a statement sent to Reuters.

Israel dealt heavy blows to Hezbollah during a war in 2024, killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah along with thousands of its fighters and destroying much of its arsenal.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHPIL3CLQFNS7L7WROKI5BU4RA.jpg?auth=1c1584d49d8308fd331adb1a6e09c970a25fca0d433987c0aa401f3409c7c08f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tram derails in central Milan leaving two dead, 40 injured</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/tram-derails-central-milan-least-one-dead-2026-02-27/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Two people were killed and around 40 injured when a tram derailed in central Milan on Friday, a spokesperson for local firefighters said.

The strikes , which Trump said were aimed at destroying Iranian missiles and annihilating its navy, follow repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike Iran again if it pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

"My administration has taken every possible step to minimise the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill," Trump said in a video shared on Truth Social.

"The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties that often happens in war, but we're doing this, not for now. We're doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission."

The U.S. military has named the operation "EPIC FURY," the Pentagon said on X.

This is the second time the U.S. has carried out strikes on Iran since Trump returned to the White House last year. The first was in June when Washington carried out a series of attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.

Saturday's strikes, unlike the first, are expected to be carried out over several days, a U.S. official told Reuters.

Tehran is preparing for retaliation, with the response set to be crushing, an Iranian official told Reuters.

The Israeli military said that Tehran had launched missiles towards Israel in response.

In his message, Trump told the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Iran's armed forces, to lay down their weapons, promising that they would be granted immunity.

The other option, according to Trump, is "certain death."

Washington and Tehran held a series of talks in recent weeks about Iran's nuclear ambitions. The most recent one was held on Thursday with no deal.

"Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades. They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can't take it anymore," Trump said.

The president first floated the idea of strikes on Iran in January amid two-week-long nationwide protests, during which thousands of people were killed by authorities.

He warned that the U.S. would come to the rescue of protesters if Iranian officials were to shoot and kill them. Trump later encouraged the protesters to continue protesting, saying that help was on the way .

Trump mentioned the killing of protesters during his statement on the strikes, telling Iranians to take cover because bombs will drop "everywhere."

"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBUEI6OGGZPAJIFHDGKAH3RQEQ.jpg?auth=6bb57e6f2450a8e7246d8d371029a0f6edda72af1633ff08e54304337724004b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia weighs halt to peace talks unless Ukraine cedes territory, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-weighs-halt-peace-talks-unless-ukraine-cedes-territory-bloomberg-news-2026-02-28/</link><description>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Russian officials increasingly see little reason to continue U.S.-led peace talks with Ukraine unless Kyiv signals it is prepared to give up territory as part of a settlement, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The New York Times, citing a U.S. official, reported that U.S. strikes on Iran were underway. A source told Reuters that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.

The attack, coming after Israel and Iran engaged in a 12-day air war in June, follows repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

"The State of Israel launched a pre-emptive attack against Iran to remove threats to the State of Israel," Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

An Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.

Explosions were heard in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian media reported, and sirens sounded across Israel around 08:15 local time in what the military said was a proactive alert to prepare the public for the possibility of an incoming missile strike.

The Israeli military announced the closure of schools and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights, and the airports authority asked the public not to go to any of the country's airports.

The U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February in a bid to resolve the decades-long dispute through diplomacy and avert the threat of a military confrontation that could destabilise the region.

Israel, however, insisted that any U.S. deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Tehran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process, and lobbied Washington to include restrictions on Iran's missile programme in the talks.

Iran said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Tehran also said it would defend itself against any attack.

It warned neighbouring countries hosting U.S. troops that it would retaliate against American bases if Washington struck Iran.

In June, the U.S. joined an Israeli military campaign against Iranian nuclear installations, in the most direct American military action ever against the Islamic Republic.

Tehran retaliated then by launching missiles toward the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest in the Middle East.

Western powers have warned that Iran's ballistic missile project threatens regional stability and could deliver nuclear weapons if developed. Tehran denies seeking atomic bombs.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJXDOGBT6NP5NPMTU6APLMRM34.jpg?auth=bee7a5338d5896ef1e65d9d0b8ca55e308d4adb05254bc9718e0de37c3b9d96a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's operation against Iran was coordinated with US, Israeli official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-operation-against-iran-was-coordinated-with-us-israeli-official-says-2026-02-28/</link><description>Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Israeli operation against Iran on Saturday was coordinated with the U.S., an Israeli defence official told Reuters.

The government in Havana has said 10 Cuban nationals coming from the United States entered Cuban waters and opened fire on a border guard vessel, leading Cuban forces to return fire killing four and wounding six others, who were taken into custody.

In an attempt to dispel doubts about its account to date, senior Cuban Interior Ministry officers displayed the captured armaments from the studio on a special television program, including bins full of at least some of the 12,846 recovered rounds.

They also showed pictures of the vessels, each peppered with bullet holes from the firefight they said took place at a range of 20 meters (66 feet).

The confrontation took place at a fraught moment in U.S.-Cuban relations, with U.S. President Donald Trump pressuring the island by imposing a virtual oil blockade after capturing and ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a crucial Cuban ally, on January 3.

Cuba has identified the assailants as Cuban exiles, some of whom had been previously placed on a list of accused terrorists, who came from the United States with the intent to sow chaos and attack military units on the Communist-ruled island.

"The intent of this group is to infiltrate, to promote public disorder. To incite the people to unite. To carry out something violent. Attack military units in order to incite social unrest and to unite the people in order to steal the revolution. That has been duly proven," said Colonel Victor Alvarez of the Interior Ministry.

U.S. politicians have expressed skepticism over Cuba's version of events. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday said his government would independently investigate, adding that it was not a U.S. operation and that no U.S. government personnel were involved.

Cuban officers said the infiltrators set out from Marathon in the Florida Keys on two vessels but ditched one at some point due to technical difficulties. They united on one speedboat, which a U.S. official said was reported stolen in Florida.

Cuba said it recovered a drone, radios, knives, a portable power plant, bolt cutters and other materiel. They also found emblems of the November 30th Movement and People's Self-Defense, anti-communist groups that oppose the Cuban government.

Cuba says a patrol of five border guard members on a 9-meter boat spotted the incoming vessel shortly after 7 a.m., with some members of the incoming crew in the water, about one nautical mile off a cay on the Caribbean island's northern coast, about 100 miles (160 km) from Marathon.

The infiltrators opened fire at a distance of 185 meters, striking the captain of the Cuban vessel in the abdomen, Cuba said. Bleeding heavily, the wounded captain remained at the helm and steered toward the enemy vessel, leading to a firefight at a distance of about 20 meters, the officers said.

Cuba called its response "proportional."

"It is a defensive model that practically never uses firearms, and the use of firearms is proportional to the type of action being carried out against our force," said Interior Ministry Colonel Ybey Carballo.

The captured Cuban nationals were receiving medical care and face charges including armed aggression, illegal entry into national territory, crimes associated with terrorist acts, and arms trafficking, prosecutor Edward Robert Campbell told the program. He said they face prison terms of up to 10 to 15 years for the lesser offenses and 20 to 30 years - or even the death penalty - for the more serious charges.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:29:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US copper mountain still growing after December import surge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-copper-mountain-still-growing-after-december-import-surge-2026-02-27/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The huge premium for delivering physical copper to the United States may have gone but the tariff trade tailwinds are still blowing hard.

U.S. imports of refined metal appeared to be waning after the White House pushed back a decision on imposing tariffs in July, collapsing the arbitrage between the CME-traded U.S. price and the London Metal Exchange (LME) international price .

But inbound flows jumped again to almost 200,000 metric tons in December, driving U.S. inventories yet higher.

The U.S. sucked in 1.4 million tons of refined copper over the course of 2025, a year-on-year increase of 730,000 tons, according to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics (WBMS), which sources data from official customs statistics.

That year-on-year jump is a good indication of the size of the metal mountain now sitting in the country.

CME stocks rose by 452,000 tons last year, pretty much matching total deliveries to exchange warehouses after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a national security investigation into the country's copper import dependency in February .

Exchange inventory has increased by another 93,000 tons since the start of 2026 with the relentless build only now starting to show signs of slowing.

However, the flow of metal has not stopped; it has been redirected to LME warehouses in Baltimore and New Orleans.

LME stocks in the two locations have grown from zero at the start of January to 36,450 tons and 10,825 tons respectively with another 30,200 tons sitting in LME off-warrant storage.

The shift in delivery focus makes sense since the spot arbitrage has flipped from a CME premium to a CME discount relative to the LME price.

CME prices are still trading at a sizeable premium to the LME on a forward basis, which suggests lingering uncertainty as to the likelihood of tariffs further down the line.

The Trump administration has flagged a potential decision around the middle of this year with the option of phasing in tariffs on refined metal from the start of 2027.

The imposition of 50% tariffs on imports of copper products such as tube and wire appears to be having the desired effect.

Inbound volumes of copper and alloy semi-manufactured products have fallen sharply since July, which is good news for U.S. fabricators and may persuade the administration to extend the measures to refined metal.

But since the core rationale of tariffs is to reduce U.S. import dependency, it might be argued that just the threat of tariffs on refined copper has already worked.

The United States has accumulated a strategic stockpile without it costing the U.S. taxpayer a cent.

What might catch the White House's attention is the continued export flow of scrap copper.

Exports of secondary copper totaled over one million tons last year, a year-on-year rise of almost 10%, according to the WBMS.

While no-one has yet committed to building a new primary processing plant in the U.S., there has been significant investment in recycling capacity.

That makes the accelerating leakage of copper scrap increasingly problematic, particularly since the single biggest destination is China.

When the U.S. imposed tariffs on copper products in July last year, the Trump administration said it would require that at least 25% of "high-quality" scrap be retained for domestic consumption.

There's been no further clarification of what exactly constitutes "high quality" scrap and since the country already consumes around 40% of the secondary metal that it generates, the threshold is already met on paper at least.

But with the European Union mulling its own restrictions on "scrap leakage", this part of the copper supply chain may be more likely to see U.S. government action than refined metal.

That said, if the copper market has learnt anything over the last year, it's that pricing U.S. tariff risk is very tricky indeed.

From the Editor

Hello Morning Bid readers!

Markets were jittery this week, as anxiety about the potential impact of the artificial intelligence revolution left investors nervous about their asset allocations and their future job prospects.

This week’s wave of worry was initially set off by a 7,000-word piece, "The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis," , opens new tab published by research firm Citrini on Sunday. It made for pretty grim reading: the loss of millions of office jobs will destroy demand, plunging the economy into a deflationary tailspin.

Is that possible? Sure, in the sense that anything is possible. But when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form blogposts, it’s time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom bubble .

The software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new round of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for AI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing them.

But, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday .

This was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of another strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive revenue beat . The $4.5 trillion chipmaker on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter and also forecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its share price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because the good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising competition and customer concentration - remain.

Meanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best performing equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI index may have slid slightly on Friday, but it’s up more than 48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest fevered speculation is at play, but that’s not necessarily the case - and there is reason to believe it could still have room to run .

Moving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount Skydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to be over, with the former coming out on top with its revised $31-a-share offer.

Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this week was the ongoing standoff between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday.

While crude prices fell following claims that progress in the negotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on Friday, trading above $71 a barrel. Discussions will resume in Vienna next week, which means the waiting game continues.

One party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+. The volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the producer group cover to stick to its “balanced market” narrative , despite many facts on the ground that suggest otherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per day increase in output when it meets on Sunday.

Speaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up though all of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47 minutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for addressing Americans’ affordability concerns, with the exception of a plan to boost Americans’ retirement savings . The president also vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a large portion of it was quashed by the Supreme Court last week.

One notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim that hyperscalers "have the obligation to provide for their own power needs" as they build out energy-hungry data centers to fuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing the grid and pushing up consumers’ electricity prices.

But the pressure is already building, and whether or not companies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion plans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure bottlenecks.

It’s a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI doomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time considering the very real physical limitations that could slow down this technological revolution.

On January 26 , gold hit $5,000 an ounce for the first time, and eleven days later , the Dow Jones Industrial Average cracked 50,000. Bullion got to its mark first – and that wasn’t supposed to happen.

Imagine if a prediction market in December 2020 had offered a proposition bet on which historic breakthrough would happen first. At that point, the Dow (.DJI) , opens new tab was already 61% of the way toward its big round number, while gold was just 37% of the way there.

Extrapolating data trends from 1985 through 2020, you would have expected the Dow to reach 50,000 by 2027 and gold not to hit the $5,000 target until 2035.

But gold's trajectory took an astonishingly sharp upturn in the last five years. Its price doubled between 2022 and 2024 alone. That surge helped the precious metal beat the stock index by what essentially amounts to a photo finish.

So why did the trendlines fail to predict the outcome?

In the case of the Dow, the index picked up speed in recent years as capital poured into U.S. markets after the pandemic, but this surge was nothing compared to the rapid spike in the yellow metal.

Analysts have offered several explanations for the dramatic acceleration in gold's gains. One underlying factor is geopolitical instability. Historically, turmoil tends to heighten demand for safe-haven assets.

And there have been plenty of reasons to worry in recent years, including the now four-year-old Russia-Ukraine war , conflicts in the Middle East , and U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff drama as well as his vow to gain control over Greenland .

Inflationary anxieties have further bolstered gold’s appeal, stoked by what many observers see as Trump’s efforts to step up political influence over the Federal Reserve. The president has long called for much lower interest rates .

His nomination of Kevin Warsh , a previous proponent of tighter monetary policy, as the next Fed chair quelled those fears somewhat at the end of January, causing gold to back off from its January 28 peak. But it remains above the $5,000 per ounce threshold.

Meanwhile, worries about a potential pickup in inflation have undermined confidence in the dollar. In response, a number of nations’ central banks have stepped up their purchases of gold in lieu of the U.S. currency.

China’s central bank certainly moved in that direction, and its households and investors also helped drive the rally. The World Gold Council , opens new tab reported a 28% year-over-year increase in the population’s purchases of gold bars and coins in 2025. Chinese gold ETFs have also enjoyed record inflows over the last year.

In short, the Dow’s rise appears to have been an acceleration of existing trends, while gold’s extreme surge was dependent on many exogenous factors and a bit of speculation – which obviously can’t be predicted beforehand.

Ultimately, though, does reaching these financial milestones truly matter?

The achievements occasioned some predictable claims , opens new tab from analysts and the financial press. These assets crossed "critical" psychological thresholds, some argued, with the suggestion that doing so could generate momentum in that direction.

But even if big round numbers like $5,000 or $50,000 have some psychological impact on investors, it's likely to be fleeting.

Consider what happened after the Dow reached previous “psychologically important” thresholds: 1,000 (November 14, 1972), 5,000 (November 21, 1995), 10,000 (March 29, 1999), and 25,000 (January 4, 2018).

In two cases, the Dow rose over the next 12 months by double digits, but it fell in the other two. Whatever warm feeling arises from seeing a commodity or index clear a seemingly significant new level can thus fade quickly once new market-moving information arrives.

One may argue that the rise of passive investing and factor-based trading could amplify any positive momentum garnered from breaking through a big round milestone – but the recent moves in gold suggest that this is not necessarily the case.

The lesson to draw from all of this is that investors would be wise to avoid relying too heavily on either the extrapolation of past price trends or the lasting effect from the latest headline-grabbing market achievements.

Milestones make for great copy, but shaky strategy.

Block (XYZ.N) , opens new tab CEO Jack Dorsey upped the urgency of the debate over whether productive chatbots will reduce employment on Thursday, when he announced , opens new tab that the payments company would fire nearly half its workers. Whether artificial intelligence really can do the work of thousands of humans, or just provides impetus to slim down a bloated organization, is unclear. Nonetheless, investors added more than $6 billion to the company’s market value on Friday morning. Such gains will help prod other firms into finding AI savings, real or illusory.

It’s hard for bosses, and more difficult for outsiders, to judge the optimal number of workers for a tech firm. When times are good, there’s the temptation to overhire, ensuring that there are enough engineers to satisfy growing demand and fix emerging problems. That comes at the obvious cost of profitability, but valuations rarely paid the price, while CEOs could reasonably fret about the dangers of underinvestment. Just look at Southwest Airlines, which learned this lesson in 2022 when a software meltdown led to over 10,000 flight cancellations.

Dorsey claims that machine learning has reset this balance of concerns, and rapidly. He said that Block had seen a 40% increase in production code shipped per engineer since September, as well as fruits of an order-of-magnitude jump in the capability and intelligence in its in-house AI framework, Goose. Hence fewer employees will do more, and faster.

Coding-adept chatbots really are remarkable. But Block also had a lot of fat to cut. The company’s headcount exploded during the pandemic, more than tripling between the pre-Covid year of 2019 and the peak in 2023.

Meanwhile, it engaged in questionable deals and breakneck expansion. It agreed to pay $29 billion in stock for buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay in 2021. Such businesses are worth far less today. Rival Klarna, for example, was valued at $46 billion that summer in a private funding round, and now trades at $5 billion. Block also bought music streaming service Tidal in a bizarre expansion, adding musician Jay-Z to the board. Then there was a big push into highly speculative cryptocurrencies, including making bitcoin wallets and a mining system. The stock has performed poorly over the past five years.

Block was far from the only technology company to overextend, especially in the frothy period exiting the pandemic. Its stock gain from pivoting away from that era, AI-driven or not, is concrete. With software valuations plummeting and machine learning fears top of mind , the signal to bosses is to fire away.

SpaceX plans to launch one million satellites that will serve as distributed cloud servers in space. These orbital data centers will supposedly harness the power of the sun to process artificial-intelligence workloads. To make it happen, Musk thinks , opens new tab he may need a satellite factory on the moon. He’ll undoubtedly need plenty of cash – which is where a potential SpaceX initial public offering comes in.

At its core, SpaceX is today a profitable satellite communication and launch business with a major lead over would-be rivals. Reuters reported , citing two people familiar with the matter, that Musk's group generated some $8 billion in EBITDA last year on $15 billion to $16 billion of sales. Starlink, its satellite broadband unit, accounted for 50% to 80% of total revenue. The implied group margin of roughly 50% is impressive for what is in large part a broadband supplier with 10 million subscribers , opens new tab worldwide.

At a $1 trillion valuation, using SpaceX's price tag from its recent merger with Grok chatbot maker xAI, it might look like the company is preparing to capture a hefty share of the global telecom market in short order. But the reality is that satellite connectivity is a complement to conventional networks – not a replacement for them. Most consumers in developed markets will find that a fixed-line broadband connection meets their needs at home, while 4G and 5G are readily available on-the-go. Demand for satellite services comes from people and places that telecom companies otherwise struggle to reach.

This isn’t a tiny market, but it will get crowded. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) , opens new tab recently got the greenlight from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to add around 4,500 more satellites to its planned constellation – taking the total to just under 8,000. Some 200 satellites have been launched so far, with the full fleet due to be in service by 2029. China, meanwhile, is developing two low-earth-orbit networks of its own: one for government and security uses and another aimed at international customers, with tens of thousands of planned satellites in total.

Though SpaceX will list with an effective monopoly in satellite communications, its deep-pocketed rivals have the ability and resources to drain Musk's moat. China’s space efforts are backed by various state-linked entities, which should bolster their chances of success. For its part, Amazon is designing , opens new tab its user terminals with low production costs in mind. If it passes these savings on, and thereby undercuts Starlink, it could gain a market foothold.

Musk’s recent political entanglements also appear to have put a theoretical cap on the size of Starlink’s government and defense business, at least outside its home market. In February 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. negotiators had used Starlink access as a bargaining chip when trying to broker a critical minerals deal with Ukraine. Though Musk denounced the claims on X, the episode clearly unsettled Ukraine’s European allies, who are seeking sovereign alternatives to the satellite service.

To this end, France invested $1.6 billion in Eutelsat Communications – the operator of the OneWeb constellation – (ETL.PA) , opens new tab last summer. The French state is now the largest shareholder in the group, which has some 600 satellites in low-earth orbit. Germany and Italy have also expressed an interest in building their own constellations for secure government and military communications. Were Musk and the U.S. still viewed as reliable partners, such measures may not even be on the table.

Threats to Starlink’s continued domination could also come from within. The recent merger of Musk’s xAI and the rockets-and-satellites group leaves SpaceX exposed to new regulatory and financial risks. According to documents seen , opens new tab by Bloomberg, xAI reported a net loss of $1.5 billion for the three months to the end of September 2025, while it burned through some $8 billion in cash in the first nine months of the year. This makes growing the top and bottom lines at Starlink look even more critical for the combined group. And there is regulatory risk, as multiple jurisdictions are investigating the Grok chatbot, which produced and circulated sexually explicit images on social network X.

All the noise around the company, and limited financial disclosures, make it tricky to value. Assume, for the sake of argument, that 70% of SpaceX's recent $1 trillion merger value is attributable to Starlink, roughly in line with its revenue contribution. That would imply a valuation of around $700 billion for the satellite unit.

Analysts at Quilty Space reckon Starlink could bring in roughly $16 billion in revenue and $11 billion in EBITDA this year. At an enterprise value of $700 billion, this would imply a forward sales multiple of 44 and an EBITDA multiple of 64. That's in the same ballpark as super-racy Palantir Technologies' (PLTR.O) , opens new tab equivalent valuations of 42 times 2026 revenue and 72 times 2026 EBITDA, using Visible Alpha data, and is therefore in a different stratosphere to the single-digit multiples of Eutelsat and telecom groups like T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) , opens new tab and Verizon Communications (VZ.N) , opens new tab .

Granted, the older communications groups are barely growing compared with Starlink, which arguably justifies a more Palantir-style multiple for Musk's business. Even then, however, it's hard to make the numbers work. Using analysts' long-term forecasts, to factor in growth expectations, Palantir trades at just under 18 times 2030 EBITDA. Applying that multiple to Starlink would imply that the satellite unit of SpaceX needs to produce $39 billion of EBITDA that year in order to justify a $700 billion enterprise value for the division.

Longtime SpaceX bulls Morgan Stanley, by comparison, think Starlink's revenue could reach almost $50 billion by 2030, which using a 50% margin would imply $25 billion of EBITDA. That's impressive, but well short of what's needed to buttress the valuation. And Morgan Stanley's forecasts look very much like a blue-sky scenario. Even if Musk pulls off a trillion-dollar stock market launch, that’s no guarantee of a smooth ride.

What started out as the Capital Markets Union (CMU) has morphed into the Savings and Investment Union (SIU). A more appropriate moniker for reviving European savings and markets might be S&amp;M, as it has involved more pain than pleasure. Even now, any meaningful progress will depend on what happens at a national level.

The campaign to kick-start European markets was born of multiple crises. The initial drive to make trading and capital raising more efficient received an impetus after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent euro zone sovereign debt meltdown exposed the bloc’s reliance on shaky banks. Brexit removed the City of London from the EU's single market. More recently, former European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi's report on competitiveness identified a 750-billion-euro investment gap for financing renewable energy, and other critical needs.

Now the EU faces even more urgent pressure to reform. U.S. President Donald Trump's at-times hostile stance has exposed the bloc's dependence on U.S. technology titans and historic lack of investment in defence. European leaders this month agreed unanimously , opens new tab to accelerate the SIU.

Reforming capital markets in a bloc of 27 countries with a combined economic output of around $20 trillion is a daunting task. The EU’s relative weakness when it comes to using equity and fixed income securities as a source of financing owes much to culture and history. The bloc has a long-standing dependence on banks, different legal frameworks, and language barriers which discourage cross-border investment.

However, a fragmented capital market with multiple local regulators and differing rules and infrastructures also points to tantalising potential efficiencies. Despite ten years of work these benefits remain out of reach. Initial public offerings in the EU raised just $17.7 billion last year, less than half the equivalent U.S. sum, as per LSEG data. Annual equity trading volumes relative to stock market capitalisation – a measure of liquidity and hence market depth – are roughly a third of the U.S. level, according to a 2025 report by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.

Scratch beneath the surface, though, and change is happening. A package of reforms to make stock market listings easier is slowly being implemented, as are moves to boost securitisation. Perhaps the most significant reforms were those proposed by the European Commission in December , opens new tab . These aim to break down barriers for cross-border capital flows by streamlining regulation and tackling a fragmented market in equities. Myriad national players are involved in the business of trading and settling securities, and the preponderance of domestic regulators and rules pushes up costs. The United States has the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which dominates the clearing and settlement of securities. By contrast, Europe has more than 30 securities depositaries charging fees nearly two-thirds higher than their counterparts stateside. This imposes a 1 billion euro , opens new tab per year cost on the continent's traders and investors, AFME reckons.

In an ideal world, all local obstacles could be removed by meshing together different players to create a single exchange on which all EU citizens can trade, connecting a capital-hungry German tech group with a Spanish saver. To some degree, that’s happening. Large players like Euronext (ENX.PA) , opens new tab and Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) , opens new tab have snapped up smaller regional bourses, centralising technology and infrastructure. Euronext bought the Athens stock exchange last year. Yet big countries like Germany and France have limited appetite for creating continent-wide operators if it means losing control of a national champion.

Brussels can still help by making regulation more efficient and removing barriers to competition. The Commission’s latest proposals include steps to make trade settlement more competitive while transferring more regulatory powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority. It is even encouraging disruption with a plan to foster blockchain-based technology that could simplify the trading and settling of shares or bonds.

These reforms move in the right direction, but will take time and may not work as intended. The drive to streamline regulation may end up increasing bureaucracy if the powers of a single supervisor overlap with local watchdogs. Countries that already benefit from vibrant markets, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, may see few benefits.

Besides, more efficient markets can only achieve so much. The United Kingdom has one of the most liquid bourses in Europe yet is struggling to attract new listings. And European stock exchanges may not be as sleepy as they first appear. Strip away the so-called Magnificent 7 tech stocks and the U.S. market is only 1.5 times more liquid than Europe’s, as measured by stock turnover relative to market capitalisation, think tank New Financial notes.

Other reforms are therefore necessary, which explains why lawmakers and market participants now talk more about the SIU than the CMU. When it comes to boosting savings and investment, governments can make big changes without pan-European coordination. Take Sweden. Draghi's report , opens new tab notes that the Scandinavian country has attracted more IPOs over the last 10 years than Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain combined. Last year it notched up two of the top , opens new tab five offerings in Europe, Middle East and Africa, including the $3.7 billion raised by security group Verisure.

Sweden’s success is down to smart incentives and a multi-decade process of reforms, which include stripping back taxes and incentivising individuals to save and invest in their pensions. Some 36% of Swedish household assets are held in stocks, outstripping Germany, France and even the UK.

Many European countries are trying to copy Stockholm’s success. Both France and Germany have started to encourage more personal pension savings. Yet they have a lot of catching up to. Europe's long history of government-run pay-as-you-go retirement schemes means pension assets are just , opens new tab 32% of GDP, versus 142% in the U.S. in 2022.

Reforms are getting harder. Europe’s ageing population has less incentive to save and governments have more debt. Past efforts have also proved misguided. The UK subsidised individual investment accounts to the tune of 8 billion pounds in 2024, yet many customers park their tax-free savings in bank deposits, doing little for growth.

This means there’s plenty of upside. New Financial estimates that, in a plausible scenario where each member state improved its performance to match the average of better-performing countries, Europe’s pool of long-term capital could grow by more than half to $44 trillion. Rather than dreaming up new pan-European acronyms, bureaucrats would be better off concentrating on local improvements.

A government source said Britain had not taken part in the strikes, and that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer would hold an emergency response meeting, a so-called COBRA meeting, on Saturday.

"Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that is why we have continually supported efforts to reach a negotiated solution," a government spokesperson said in a statement.

"As part of our longstanding commitments to the security of our allies in the Middle East, we have a range of defensive capabilities in the region, which we have recently bolstered. We stand ready to protect our interests," the spokesperson said.

Britain does not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict, the spokesperson added.

Britain's immediate priority was the safety of its nationals in the region, and it would provide consular assistance, according to the statement.

The government also issued a notice on Saturday advising against all travel to Israel and the Palestinian territories, after advising on Friday against non-essential travel in the regions.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:53:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IH6HEWEG7RLFDCKOFAZ5JENJWQ.jpg?auth=fbab2f42eb5d69592d570bac11ad0cba50060106c058e68e0a3094aeb9811002&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: After El Mencho's killing, his cartel's power endures deep inside the US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/after-el-menchos-killing-his-cartels-power-endures-deep-inside-us-2026-02-28/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Mexican government's killing of one of the world's biggest kingpins, known as " El Mencho ," is being heralded as a major blow to drug trafficking.

But it did little to dismantle his cartel's critical U.S. operations, which will continue fueling its dominance unless Washington steps up the fight inside its own territory, U.S. and Mexican security sources said.

Mexican special forces killed the elusive drug lord Nemesio Oseguera in a U.S.-backed raid on Feb. 22. It was the biggest takedown of a cartel kingpin in at least a decade.

El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel responded by torching buildings and blockading roads across Mexico in a terrifying display of its territorial reach that grabbed headlines worldwide.

On the U.S. side of the border, the cartel also has extensive networks that receive far less attention yet are the lifeblood of its power and profits, current and former U.S. and Mexican officials said. These enable it to source military-grade weapons, smuggle billions of dollars' worth of fuel, and launder billions more in cartel cash.

"The United States has become increasingly important to cartels, especially the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, for it to thrive," said Alamdar Hamdani, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that the Trump administration "has worked closely with the Mexican government to stop the scourge of drugs and criminals entering our country" and that this cooperation led to the "elimination of infamous narcoterrorist 'El Mencho.'"

"The president will continue to do everything in his power to keep America safe from these vicious criminals and the drugs they use to poison our country," she added.

Washington heaped pressure on Mexico to step up the cartel fight ahead of the raid against the once untouchable drug lord.

Such actions are risky for the Mexican government because they can spark a wave of violence in a country where the drug war has already cost tens of thousands of lives.

The decision by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to escalate her crackdown has prompted renewed calls for the U.S. to do more on its side of the border.

"The United States can't turn a blind eye to Mexico's demands any longer," said Mexican Congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, a close ally of Sheinbaum.

He said the U.S. needed to improve efforts to go after money laundering, fuel smuggling and, above all, weapons smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico.

"We can't stop drug traffickers if the United States continues allowing them to strengthen their military capabilities," he said.

The U.S. has built and prosecuted hundreds of cases related to cartel-related activity inside the U.S. in recent years.

But the Trump administration last year diverted thousands of agents , including many specializing in drugs, firearms, and money laundering, away from such cases and to the mass deportation effort.

Reuters also reported in September that the number of people charged with drug conspiracies and money laundering fell significantly last year.

"The Trump administration has predominantly focused on highly militarized actions against drugs abroad and has not paid similar attention to actions at home," said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a security expert.

A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Justice said the administration was "acutely focused on securing the border, prosecuting violent traffickers, deporting any and all members of cartel networks and ensuring they are held accountable for their horrific crimes against the American people."

The department also pointed to a string of recent cases, including against high-ranking members of the Jalisco cartel.

The office of Mexico's president did not respond to requests for comment.

Roberto Velasco, the Undersecretary for North America at Mexico's Foreign Ministry, said the Mexican government has repeatedly emphasized in bilateral meetings and working groups that stopping arms trafficking is a top Mexican priority.

"While there has been some significant progress, we believe much more can be done to control this flow and to target the networks in the United States that facilitate it, empowering transnational criminal organizations," he said.

Reuters spoke to a dozen current and former U.S. and Mexican officials after El Mencho's killing and reviewed U.S. court documents from 10 recent cases related to the cartel to gain better insight into its U.S. operations.

What emerged was a picture of U.S.-based activities that are critical to the cartel's firepower and profits and unlikely to be impacted by the death of its leader. Reuters reporting also revealed how U.S. companies and professionals – from fuel traders to cell phone retailers to stockbrokers – are complicit in cartel activity.

"There's a lot of economic integration - both legal and illegal," said Alexia Bautista, a former Mexican diplomat.

When Mexican Special Forces descended on a cabin in a picturesque mountain town where El Mencho was waiting for a visit from his girlfriend , the cartel leader's men fought back – armed predominantly with U.S. weapons, Mexican Army chief Ricardo Trevilla said at a press conference.

Some 80% of the 23,000 weapons the Mexican government has seized since Sheinbaum took office in late 2024 came from the U.S., he added.

The Jalisco cartel, in particular, has become adept at sourcing heavy, military-grade artillery from U.S. gun shops across the country, according to U.S. and Mexican authorities.

Through one of its gun-running networks, the cartel obtained guns from more than a dozen U.S. states, including .50 caliber rifles capable of downing helicopters and FN SCAR assault rifles designed for U.S. Special Forces, according to a Reuters investigation .

While such firepower can be purchased legally in the U.S., the arms become illegal once they enter Mexico, which has tight gun regulations.

"We complain about the Mexicans' lack of effort to go after the drugs down there, but then why does the U.S. dismiss their argument that we could do better on the guns going southbound?" said Derek Maltz, former acting administrator for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

"The U.S. has to step up in a lot of areas," he said, citing not only arms trafficking prosecutions but also public health and mental illness programs to curb American drug demand.

Americans' insatiable demand for narcotics has long fueled the cartels' profits. But while drugs are the cash cow, in less than a decade the groups have quietly built a multi-billion dollar cross-border petroleum empire.

The Jalisco cartel dominates this business, which would have been impossible to expand without a network of knowingly or unknowingly complicit U.S. companies that includes refiners, fuel traders, transport companies and storage facilities, as Reuters reported in October.

"This is no longer stealing fuel from (state energy company) Pemex ," said Guadalupe Correa, a professor at George Mason University who has studied how cartels diversify their income streams. "It's a huge, transnational business."

The cartel orchestrates two versions of the scheme, according to U.S. and Mexican authorities.

In Mexico, cartel members steal crude oil from Pemex that is then smuggled across the border where it gets sold to U.S. companies. In the other direction, cartel members purchase mostly diesel and gasoline from U.S. companies via shell companies. The fuel arrives in Mexico disguised as something else, in what boils down to a very lucrative tax fraud.

Sheinbaum confirmed last year that U.S. business people had been involved in the fuel smuggling cases under investigation. "One cannot explain otherwise how fuel comes from the U.S. to Mexico, and enters illegally," she said.

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN CARTEL-RELATED ASSETS IN U.S.

In late 2024, El Mencho's son-in-law Cristian Gutierrez Ochoa was arrested in a $1.2 million house in Riverside, California.

According to the court records, Gutierrez, who pled guilty to an international money laundering conspiracy in June 2025, said he bought the five-bedroom property using drug proceeds funneled through a Mexico-based shell company set up to look like a tequila producer.

Real estate is one of myriad ways Jalisco cartel cleans its cash in the U.S.

In many of the schemes, the involvement of U.S. businesses is key, said Carlos Olivo, a former DEA agent who specialized in tracing the cartel's U.S. financial networks. He said the cartel's money flows through restaurants, textiles, the music industry, the agricultural sector and even the U.S. stock market.

"In total, we're talking about hundreds of millions in assets in cartel-related money in the United States," he said.

In response to questions about this story, a DEA spokesperson said the cartels employed a wide range of money laundering schemes and "also use trade-based money laundering schemes, cryptocurrency, bulk cash, and Chinese underground banking systems to fund their operations."

Alejandro Celorio, a former Mexican diplomat, said he hoped that Sheinbaum's decision to go after the most powerful cartel leader in the country would inspire the U.S. to redouble its efforts – inside its own borders.

"As the world's leading commercial and military power, the U.S. could certainly investigate more deeply how money and drugs move within U.S. territory," Celorio said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 11:24:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4QUCCPSZ7VLA3BTEYECHODDII4.jpg?auth=28d89e28f9bd4b81055cf1c74cef486276c644f7f93d395fb356e1a5fd4268f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US-Israeli attack triggers fear and panic in Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-israeli-attack-triggers-fear-panic-iran-2026-02-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Long queues formed at gas stations and many Iranians began heading out of cities in search of safety, witnesses said, as an attack by the United States and Israel on Iran spread fear and panic throughout the country.

Explosions rocked Tehran and columns of smoke rose into the sky on Saturday morning, shaking the city at the start of the Iranian working week. One man, speaking to Reuters from the capital, said he was rushing to get his children from school.

"We are scared, we are terrified. My children are shaking, we have nowhere to go, we will die here," said Minou, a 32-year-old mother of two from the northern city of Tabriz, one of many areas where explosions were reported.

"What is going to happen to my children?," she said, crying as she spoke by phone.

Iran's top security body said it expected attacks to continue in Tehran and some other cities, and therefore urged people to "travel to other cities where possible so that you may remain safe from the harm of these two regimes’ acts of aggression". Schools and universities would be closed until further notice.

The attack marks the latest upheaval for Iranians just weeks after thousands of people were killed in a government crackdown on nationwide unrest, and comes just eight months after last year's 12-day war with Israel, during which the United States bombed Iranian nuclear sites .

U.S. President Donald Trump said the operation would end a security threat to the United States and offer Iranians a chance to topple their rulers. The Pentagon said that U.S. strikes against Iran were named "OPERATION EPIC FURY."

An Iranian from the central city of Yazd said he hoped that the attack would topple the clerical establishment that has run the country since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. "Let them bomb," the resident of Yazd said.

But Samira Mohebbi, speaking from the northern city of Rasht, disagreed.

"I am against this regime, to hell with them. But I don't want my country to be attacked by foreign forces, I don't want my Iran to turn into Iraq," she said, referring to the neighbouring country that suffered years of chaos and bloodshed following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.

Security forces blocked roads in the area of Tehran that is home to the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Masoud Pezeshkian, and parliament, witnesses said.

The attacks came after the latest round of negotiations between the United States and Iran in Geneva on Thursday failed to secure a breakthrough over Tehran's nuclear programme, though Omani mediators had reported progress.

"They said the nuclear talks are going well. They fooled us again," said a resident of Tehran.

Western governments have long suspected Iran aims to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran has always denied this.

Witnesses said people were rushing to buy hard currency.

In Isfahan, another area where attacks were reported, some said they were unable to withdraw cash from ATMs.

Reza Saadati, 45, said he was taking his family to the city of Urumieh near the Turkish border. "If the border is open, we will cross and then fly to Istanbul," he said.

Mohammad Esmaili, 63, speaking from the town of Ilam, some 500 km (300 miles) from Tehran, said he would leave the town with his family. "God knows what will happen to us. Pray for us," he said.

A mother of three from Tehran said: "People are shocked, scared. What is going to happen to us? Save us please."</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 11:24:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AYZ2SIURQRJDDDLCWACUOXA7PQ.jpg?auth=64e713883070b0bceb9c1c5126bb390c5776d3137de7328e0efdb779b7de6adb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece advises Greek-flagged vessels to avoid some shipping routes after strikes on Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greece-advises-greek-flagged-vessels-avoid-some-shipping-routes-after-strikes-2026-02-28/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Greece's shipping ministry advised Greek-flagged vessels on Saturday to exercise maximum vigilance and avoid the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz following strikes by the United States and Israel against Iran, according to an advisory seen by Reuters.

"The developing situation affects the safety of navigation in the wider Persian Gulf, the Straits of Hormuz, the Gulf of Oman and the North Arabian Sea," the document said, advising managing companies to implement the highest level of security measures in those areas and Israeli ports until further notice.

It added that it could not rule out the spread of the crisis to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden due to links between Iran and Iran-aligned Houthi militants.

The advisory also warned ships to be vigilant for potential missile or drone attacks, strikes on port facilities, harassment or electronic interference and disruptions to the electronic navigation systems of ships.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 11:24:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CMHOPRUJQFKGBF62JK3VOTQN54.jpg?auth=8d82933f3e0f7f7b50017e21c57fd57eaad2c8955c6b9b7a026e364bc422d768&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia suspends flights to Iran and Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/russia-suspends-flights-iran-israel-2026-02-28/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Russian Ministry of Transport said on Saturday that Russian air carriers had suspended flights to Iran and Israel.

Israel said it launched a pre-emptive attack against Iran on Saturday, pushing the Middle East into a renewed military confrontation and further dimming hopes for a diplomatic solution to Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West.

The ministry said that in connection with the closure of Iranian and Israeli airspace, Russian air carriers, in cooperation with the ministry and Rosaviatsiya aviation watchdog, had worked out alternative flight routes in advance to ensure safe flights to the Persian Gulf countries.

Flight times will increase due to the longer distances, it said.

Rosaviatsiya said in a separate statement published later on Saturday that it had issued recommendations for Russian air carriers after Bahrain, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait had closed their airspace to ensure flight safety, and UAE authorities had also introduced temporary restrictions on the use of their airspace.

The Russian airspace watchdog said carriers are advised to choose alternative routes when flying to the Persian Gulf countries, observing all safety measures and actively monitoring the recommendations of the aviation authorities of foreign states.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 11:25:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T2BUMVIUORIF3EEHRO5QTMZ4EY.jpg?auth=9f5ea76cd70cb0ddf9dc25f129752971c36b73e16d2686f54001ae0be1fc0ad9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran fires missiles at Gulf Arab states, one killed in Abu Dhabi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-fires-missiles-gulf-arab-states-one-killed-abu-dhabi-2026-02-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Several Gulf Arab states said they were targeted by Iranian missiles on Saturday after Tehran pledged to retaliate against strikes by the United States and Israel, bringing conflict to a part of the Arab world that prides itself on relative safety.

State media in the United Arab Emirates said one person had been killed in Abu Dhabi, but gave no details.

Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, all of which have a U.S. military presence, said they had intercepted the Iranian missiles.

"All occupied territories and the criminal U.S. bases in the region have been struck by the powerful blows of Iranian missiles. This operation will continue relentlessly until the enemy is decisively defeated," Iran's Revolutionary Guards said.

Bahrain confirmed an attack inside its territory and said a service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet had been struck. Video from a Reuters witness showed a plume of grey smoke rising near the small island nation's coast as sirens wailed.

Loud booms were heard across Abu Dhabi, according to five witnesses including two Reuters correspondents. Some residents received a phone alert telling them to shelter in the closest secure building and stay away from windows because of missile threats.

One witness told Reuters she heard five booms in rapid succession that caused windows in a house near Abu Dhabi's Corniche to vibrate. Other witnesses in the Al Dhafra and Bateen areas heard loud booms as well.

Fighter jets could be seen flying around the Yas Island area of Abu Dhabi on Saturday afternoon.

In Qatar, the military said in a statement that it had intercepted incoming Iranian missiles before they reached Qatari territory after "joint coordination". Several successive waves of blasts were heard in the Qatari capital Doha.

After the U.S. Embassy issued a warning to take shelter in Doha, many residents carried on their usual activities. Shoppers were in supermarkets, beachgoers headed to the seaside and a yellow double-decker tour bus filled with tourists drove through the city's West Bay district.

Later, when the government pushed a shelter-in-place warning to mobile phones, fewer people were seen out in the streets and traffic thinned.

The Kuwaiti army says it dealt with missiles in Kuwaiti airspace, while Jordan said it had downed two Iranian ballistic missiles.

Global airlines suspended flights across the Middle East, with flight maps showing the airspace over Iran virtually empty.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 11:46:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7NAXLYAZVJPAXHBYLADJN4UA4I.jpg?auth=c3588102ce5389f72a9ca183e6a8afdb94da4802495ecd723a6a84a28ae06f67&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO closely following developments in Iran and region, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nato-closely-following-developments-iran-region-spokesperson-says-2026-02-28/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - NATO is closely following developments in Iran and the region , NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 11:46:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7QTTJOJV5M7XILHFWBXQGIZCI.jpg?auth=f31506b36c00db9f6927c72d92520405525ff641c031f1d5eafb6268129e5ef0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greeks rally to mark anniversary of deadly 2023 train crash ahead of trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greeks-rally-mark-anniversary-deadly-2023-train-crash-ahead-trial-2026-02-28/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Greeks rallied in Athens and other cities on Saturday to mark the anniversary of a 2023 train crash, the country's deadliest rail disaster in history, demanding justice ahead of a criminal trial set to begin next month.

Trains and ferries came to a halt and urban transport was disrupted as workers walked off the job to join the demonstrations. Protesters laid flowers and held banners reading "Justice" outside parliament, where the names of the 57 victims - mostly students - have been spray‑painted in red on the ground.

The victims died when a passenger train and a freight train collided head-on at Tempi in central Greece.

The disaster has become a stark symbol of state failings, including safety lapses and years of neglect of the rail network.

Fuelled by mistrust of politicians, who are largely shielded from prosecution under Greek law, last year’s mass protests were the biggest in years.

Thousands of police officers were deployed in Athens on Saturday. Demonstrations were also held abroad.

"We seek one thing: Justice," said Pavlos Aslanidis, head of the victims' relatives association in a speech.

A judicial investigation concluded this year and dozens of non-politicians will stand trial on March 23 on charges ranging from traffic disruption leading to deaths to negligent manslaughter and causing bodily harm.

Protesters want reforms and political accountability. "It wasn't an accident, it was murder," read one banner in Athens.

Probes have found that a project co-funded by the European Union to install safety systems was launched in 2014 but was years behind schedule in 2023. Relatives have also accused authorities of trying to cover up evidence.

The centre-right government, which denies wrongdoing, says justice will shed light on the case and has pledged full railway reform by 2027.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 12:58:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JLVCOMXPB5P2DPXLPBBNMUCYFU.jpg?auth=977ac81a47ba1df4d722bb88f782022247872b1b69b86b12b0273e1db9476cbb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel shuts schools, bans gatherings as Iran launches retaliatory missiles</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/israel-shuts-schools-bans-gatherings-iran-launches-retaliatory-missiles-2026-02-28/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Israel banned public gatherings, shut schools and workplaces and moved hospital patients to underground facilities on Saturday as Tehran launched missiles towards Israel in retaliation for a joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran.

Defence Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency across the country, warning the public of Iranian missile and drone attacks.

The military ordered the public to follow emergency guidance as it announced tens of thousands of reservists were being called up for service, including to reinforce its land borders. The police urged against non-essential travel so as to allow security and emergency vehicles to move freely.

Protected by a sophisticated air defence system, some Israelis went to the beach in Tel Aviv on Saturday ahead of the initial Iranian response, saying they felt safe and voicing support for an operation against Iran.

"It's about time," said Shira Dorany as she took a walk along Tel Aviv's Mediterranean-front promenade.

"I don't want to wait anymore for what's coming. Now, it's coming. Let's finish it."

There were few reports of damage or injuries from Iran's initial missile barrages. Israelis generally have access to bomb shelters and are warned to rush to them by a nationwide alert system.

Israel and Iran last year faced off in an aerial war, after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran in June that the United States later joined. The war lasted 12 days, killing over 30 people in Israel and more than 900 in Iran.

Tel Aviv, where several military sites are located, suffered multiple strikes during last year's war, as did parts of southern Israel where there are some military bases.

Israel on Saturday closed its airspace to civilian flights though land borders with Egypt and Jordan remained open, according to a spokesperson from the airport authority.

The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem said government personnel had been advised to shelter in place, after on Friday warning staff they should leave the country if they wished to.

In Jerusalem, people were seen rushing to buy food and withdraw money as explosions from missile interceptions echoed across the city.

At the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, medical workers were moving entire hospital wards underground.

"(Sheba) switched to advanced preparedness mode in preparation for the strike in Iran. We are in the process of moving all our departments and services into protected areas," said Itai Pessach, the medical center's director general.

At the beach in Tel Aviv, Maayan Eliasi, 43, said Israeli strikes on Iran were necessary "to establish that we are strong."

"We are not scared, and we are here to protect our land."</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 12:58:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HNHDY5W3CRNN5M6OSEWZS6GTXM.jpg?auth=1035d49133f27bf78f2591084ae7b8a18ee131aa1e9a094ca9d41f6f710286eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four people killed in Syria after an Iranian missile falls on building, state media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/four-people-killed-syria-after-an-iranian-missile-falls-building-state-media-2026-02-28/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Four people were killed and several others wounded when an Iranian missile struck a building in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Saturday, the state news agency SANA said.

Other missile debris fell in the city of Quneitra and the Yarmouk Basin in Daraa province in southern Syria, according to Reuters witnesses and videos shared by residents.

The sounds of warplanes were heard repeatedly in the skies over Syria on Saturday, after the United States and Israel announced a military operation against Iran.

The United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, targeting its leadership and plunging the Middle East into a new conflict.

Rosatom said it had evacuated all employees' children, as well as "non-essential staff" and anyone who wished to leave the country - a total of 94 people.

"We are constantly monitoring the situation and assessing the risks. If necessary, additional measures will be taken in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the safety of our employees," Likhachev said.

He did not provide details on the situation at Bushehr but said that nuclear facilities "should not be targeted under any circumstances."

Bushehr, built by Russia, is Iran's only operational nuclear power plant. Russian personnel work at the site.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 12:59:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4U4NKMASN5KARKSFV3PNHRTK3E.jpg?auth=a455e5723efa7ecd0ab267b6b966d874c940c3c143553dc8db7c50dd5822cc4d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's Macron calls for urgent meeting of U.N. security council on Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-macron-calls-urgent-meeting-un-security-council-iran-2026-02-28/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying the outbreak of a war between the United States, Israel and Iran has "serious consequences" for international peace and security.

Macron spoke separately with leaders of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and the president of the autonomous region of Kurdistan, his office said.

France was ready to deploy the necessary resources to protect its closest partners at their request, Macron said on X.

"The current escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop. The Iranian regime must understand that it now has no other option but to engage in good-faith negotiations to end its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as its actions to destabilize the region," Macron said.

"This is absolutely essential for the security of everyone in the Middle East," he added.

"The Iranian people must also be able to build their future freely. The massacres perpetrated by the Islamic regime discredit it and necessitate that the people be given a voice. The sooner the better."

The United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, plunging the Middle East into a new conflict that President Donald Trump said would end a security threat to the United States and offer Iranians a chance to topple their rulers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 12:59:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BYGZR7B5FBLCDM3TQG5YOS3LNY.jpg?auth=db9cab5133574200eae9d68bf2c1bf7204d5ed2cf53d60bcbd83321172a3f597&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
